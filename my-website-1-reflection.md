Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
On the upper-right hand corner of your Github page, click on the + symbol and click on 'new repository'. Assign the repository a name, and appropriate license, and click on 'create repository' when finished.
To clone the repository, on this new repository's page, there is a HTTPS clone URL. Copy the URL, then go to the command line and once you are in the appropriate directory, enter 'git clone URL', replacing URL with the URL you copied.

Describe what open source means.
Open source is the practice of freely and openly sharing the source code of a project for anyone to do whatever they want with it (some licenses might be more restrictive), as long as they attach credit to the original source.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
I think it's great that there are great projects out there that are becoming ever better through this 'crowd-programming' phenomenon. I don't think there's need to be nervous because this open-source option is not obligatory, so if I don't feel comfortable sharing something I've produced, then I can elect not to make it open-source.

Assess the importance of using licenses.
Licenses allow others to help me on my project. Licenses also allow for variability in terms of rights that I'm relinquishing as owner.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
While it took some time to get used to (and still getting used to it), I thought everything was presented in a straight-forward manner and didn't leave me puzzled at any point.

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
I just reviewd all the resources presented to me in this curriculum.
