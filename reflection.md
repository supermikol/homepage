####What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
Padding is the spacing between the border and the text, whereas, margin is the spacing between objects in between borders.

####What did you learn about CSS positioning?
I learned that CSS positioning can be very versatile, and can allow me to manipulate objects however I want on the screen, given that I know how to use the code properly.

####What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
The easiest was laying out the biggest blocks, such getting the nav bar on top, the side bar on the side, and the footer on the bottom. It was the details that was more challenging,  for example, getting the social media links to appear in a 'table'(without using tables) and lining up properly. Vertical centering was something I got stuck on for a while.

The most problematic issue was getting the footer to stay on the bottom when I had used absolute positioning for the "bar" on the right hand side. Clearing didn't do the trick as a result, so the footer kept getting embedded underneath the information on the right hand side.

####What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

This challenge didn't really involve any new knowledge (at least none I can recall right now, perhaps because my brain is partly fried after all this) so I wouldn't say there was any 'learning' involved. However, I think this really reinforced and clarified a lot of the positioning functions that we've learned. Overall, I was very engaged during these several hours.
