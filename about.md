title: About Me
---

#####Born and raised in San Francisco, I left when I was 18 to embark for college at UCLA, and never turned back, eventually going to China where I've been for the past 4 years. With a close friend of mine, we started an [education company](http://www.cunshande.com) helping students here apply for schools in the US.

#####Now after a decade of diverse experiences, I find myself back where it all started. I'm back, San Francisco!


###Some fun facts:
* I once lived in a buddhist monastry for 3 months during high school. It's based in Ukiah, and it's called "City of Ten Thousand Buddhas"

* I speak a rather obscure dialect of Chinese (Minnan) that is more commonly spoken in Taiwan.
* Although my heritage is Chinese, my parents were born and raised in Vietnam. I also grew up in the Tenderloin, where there is a sizeable Vietnamese population, so I grew up eating Vietnamese food. It's still one of my favorite cuisines.
* I was on the set of Amazing Spiderman (the one with Andrew Garfield). Random series of events led to me being chosen for a background role, and I was flown to New York (from LA) for a few days. If you pay attention to the lab scene right before Peter Parker gets bitten, you'll see me!

* My greatest petpeeve: Missing oxford comma
