To be honest, when we first started learnin html/css, I was pretty certain that I was not meant for front-end development. It was tedious, boring, CSS oftentimes just refuses to listen to you, and most importantly, I was never considered an artistic person.

However, in the process, I discovered that website development has it's perks--mainly in terms of immediate gratification. It's incredibly rewarding to learn something that immediately translates into something that people can see and understand. I show my friends and brother my site and tell them that it took less than a month (technically three weeks in terms of html/css/js/jeckyll) to put together all this, and they're all incredibly impressed. Compare this to all those loops and functions we've created, that really haven't amounted to anything. Given, I still enjoy programming in Ruby/JS much more than html/css, but it's nice to be able to show people what i've done, which would not be possible with the pure programming languages alone.

With this week, Jekyll was particularly interesting. I almost gave up in the beginning because the directions were a bit vague and I wasn't sure how Jekyll worked even though I followed all the directions. Thankfully, I came across a good youtube video that gave me a good high-level understanding of how Jekyll functioned. It was 15 minutes. What came after was about 10 hours of learning Jekyll, then implementing a template, and then translating all my existing pages into Jekyll pages. Hell of an experience. In the end though, I'm extremely glad I didn't give up on Jekyll, because now I'm that ever bit more confident with my webpage design ability, and as long as I've got a solid template, I feel that I can put *almost* anything together.

This is the last week of phase-0, and in addition to that, I'm moving out of my apartment in China, and am getting ready to leave for the US tomorrow (albeit for just a few months). I'm definitely closing a significant chapter in my life, and getting read to peer into the next. It's full of uncertainty, but I'm full of nothing but optimism in what this upcoming future will bring. I hope you will share my excitement with me.

To all of my cohort, I look forward to meeting you all!
