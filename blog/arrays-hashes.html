        <h2>Hash Vs. Array</h2>
          <div class="date">11/14/2015</div>
          <p>What is an array? In simple terms, it’s a storage space for information. Picture a cabinet with multiple drawers, each one capable of storing a single piece of information. It’s also infinitely large, so you can store as many items in it as you want. Enough talking, let’s demonstrate.</p>
          Let’s start by explaining what an array is. In simple terms, it’s a storage space for information. Picture a cabinet with multiple drawers, each one capable of storing a single piece of information. It’s also infinitely large, so you can store as many items in it as you want. Enough talking, let’s demonstrate.
          <p>Assume I want to create a simple array of personal information about myself, I can create an array that looks like the following:</p>
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/supermikol/ac234a47fd3240047154.js"></script>

          <p>This array contains 3 items, specifically, [full name], [country], and [occupation]. In some cases, I may want to break up [full name] into two separate objects of [first name] and [last name], but for simplicity sake, let’s keep it as [full name]. The order I enter it in is fixed, so that whenever I call the second item of this array through the code </p>
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/supermikol/f04e824a1bfc53580006.js"></script>
          <p>it will always return “China” unless I manipulate the array. (Note that the 1 here is actually referring to the second item in the array, because the first item in the array always starts with 0) Very handy, because let’s say I have an individual arrays for everyone in my office, then, whenever I need to look up David’s occupation, I can simply look up the third item through:</p>
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/supermikol/90d6fa83f0ac11684ab8.js"></script>
          <p>In a simple database system where the main set of information is this specific array format, the array is a perfect structure for storing information.</p>

          <p>However, what if I have an array with an incredibly long list of items? For example:
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/supermikol/e135434666fb7ba39a96.js"></script>
          In other words, your facebook profile.</p>
          <p>Then let’s say I want to look up someone’s last place of employment, I would have to look up the fact that it’s actually array item number 10, before I can refer to david[9]. Or perhaps I want to find out your favorite restaurant; with some digging, it turns out it’s the item david[2380]. You can see how things can get out of hand easily. On the other hand, wouldn’t it be awesome if I could just look up david[“favorite_restaurant”] and it returns "In N Out"? Isn’t that much more intuitive than looking up an arbitrary number referring to the order of the information within the array?</p>

          <p>That’s where hashes come in. Hashes are a more malleable form of array, where you define not only the value in the hash, but also a key. For instance, if I were to recreate the array example above using a hash instead, it would look like this:</p>
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/supermikol/21d47c82d9cc22ac3d0e.js"></script>
          <p>The first value is always the ‘key’ and the latter value is the ‘value’. Now if I need to look up mike’s occupation, I can directly input mikehash[“occupation”] and it will return "teacher".</p>
          <p>One thing to note is that you can have multiple ‘values’ that are equal, but keys must always be distinct. For instance, I cannot have two ‘fullname’ keys pointing to different values, because then the lookup doesn’t work.(which value is it going to pull up when you ask for it?)  However, I can have two values that are the same (for example, favorite_country and current_country can have the same value).</p>
          <p>Under this format, as long as I define my keys clearly, it’s short work to look up any value within a hash as long as I’ve got the key ready.</p>
          <p>Anyway, this concludes my blog for this week! Hope you've learned a thing or two.</p>
