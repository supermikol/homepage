How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
It was very insightful to see how my partner approached wireframing and coding, so overall, I really appreciated the process.
Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Yes, because it provided that general frame of reference for us as we decided how to break up the page in terms of the div's we were using.
What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
Our wireframes actually aren't very similar, but we did agree that it should contain the same frame we used for our landing page, meaning it should include the navigation bar, our photo, and links to our social media pages.
What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
Div ids were helpful for mentally keeping track of the various sections on our pages.
